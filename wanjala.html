    Kenya’s geography
    Even if you’ve never been to Kenya, chances are you know what it looks like. Kenya’s savannah is familiar from movies, TV shows, books and even adverts on the telly. It’s the landscape many people imagine when they think of Africa.

    Kenya’s nature
    Kenya facts
    
    Millions of people visit Kenya each year to see its endless savannah and the animals that inhabit it: elephants, lions, cheetahs, giraffes, zebras, hippos, rhinos and more. The Kenyan government has set up more than 50 reserves and parks to protect these animals.
    
    People hoping to spot some amazing African wildlife usually focus on Kenya’s lowland savannah. But Kenya’s ecosystems also include deserts, swamps, mountain and forests. Each region has its own mix of plants and animals that are suited to the area’s particular conditions. Kenya’s highland forests are home to many animals found nowhere else in the world!

    Kenyan government & economy
    Kenya was a colony of the United Kingdom from 1920 until 1963. Since its independence, it has been a republic, with a president, a national assembly, called the Bunge, and a legal system. Each year on 12 December, the country celebrates its independence day – or Jamhuri Day – with parades, dancing, political speeches and feasts!
